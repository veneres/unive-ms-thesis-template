# Ca' Foscari University LaTeX Master Thesis Template
The main structure of this document has been provided by [https://github.com/Cinofix/latex-scientific-templates](Cinofix).\\
There is not an official template for a master thesis written in LaTex, so this template with the class ``univemaster'' aims to fill this gap.
The Ca' Foscari University logo is a modified version of the one downloadable from [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Logo_Universit%C3%A0_Ca%27_Foscari_Venezia.svg) and all rights belong to Ca' Foscari University of Venice.
